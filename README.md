## How To 1st Install & Run

### Prerequisites

Before you start, it's recommended to have installed:

- [nvm â€“ Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) -> ^20.x.x

### Installation

After cloning the repository, you just need to run the command `npm run setup`

Also, to check for format & linting issues and unit tests, you can run `npm run check`

### Running Locally

I used the extension VS Code's extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). It's just opening the `index.html` file (inside the **src** folder) with the extension.
